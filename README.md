The laser-induced plasma micromachining (LIPMM) process has numerous advantages in its use in precision engineering and advanced manufacturing applications. However, it is highly dependent on the plasma-workpiece distance. Even tens of microns of change in the plasma-workpiece distance results in large differences in the machined depth. Therefore, it is imperative that this distance be maintained within a few tens of microns to generate machined features with uniform depth for tight tolerance engineering applications. In this work, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model as a regression problem has been developed utilizing images taken by a CCD camera during the LIPMM process. 96% of the tested plasma-workpiece distance examples were predicted within a 20 Î¼m error with an RMSE value of 9.19. This technique might act as a robust and cheap alternative to other complex and expensive sensor-based approaches for the control of the plasma-workpiece distance.
